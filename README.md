#App Details

The app was built on Objective-C and Apple's foundation library with Swift mixed in via bridging headers. Each story is encoded in JSON, where different display formats are denoted and the all the elements are in an array. I wrote an parser to be able to determine which elements to display based on the JSON data. Hence, all the stories are dynamic and new stories can be added easily.

The JSON data files are stored locally on the phone but could easily be drawn from the internet via HTTP requests. 

The design philsophy behind the applicatoin is easy readability and emphasis on media content. I created multiple ways to display photos, quotes, etc. to make an interesting reading experience for every article.
